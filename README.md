# Next Task Manager

This is a Kanban style task manager application with drag and drop functionality for things like lists and cards

## Installation

After cloning this project to your local machine, make sure to go into both the client and server directories and downloading the `node modules`.
You can achieve this by running `npm install` command if you're using npm, in the case that you are using yarn you can simply delete the `package-lock.json` files
in both the client and server directories and then in each of those directories running `yarn` command should yeild the same result.

## Getting started

After installation is complete, you can open your terminal with two tabs open; One for the client and one for the server. If you're using npm, you should be able
to get the client and the server started with the `npm run dev` command. In the case that you are using yarn, you should be able to just use `yarn dev` for the client
and the server to get the same result.

In the browser you can then visit `http://localhost:3000` for the client side of the application.

**####Note that you must have the server running as well as the client**
