# Next Task Manager

This is a Kanban style task manager application

## Installation

After cloning this project to your local machine, make sure to go into both the client and server directories and downloading the `node_modules`.
You can achieve this by running `npm install` if you're using npm, in the case that you are using yarn you can simply delete the `package-lock.json` files
in both the client and server directories and then in each of those directories running `yarn` should yeild the same result.

## Getting started

After installation is complete, you can open your terminal with two tabs open; One for the client and one for the server. If you're using npm, you should be able
to get the client started with the `npm run dev` command and you can get the server started with the `npm run dev` command. In the case that you are using yarn, you
should be able to just use `yarn dev` to get the client started and `yarn dev` to get the server started.

In the browser you can then visit 'http://localhost:3000' for the client side of the application.
**Note that you must have the server running as well as the client**
